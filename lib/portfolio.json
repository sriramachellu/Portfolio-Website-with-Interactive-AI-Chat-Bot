The project focuses on designing a low latency Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that delivers grounded responses over uploaded PDF collections. It integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash with Vertex AI embeddings, leveraging 768 dimensional vector search for semantic retrieval. The architecture emphasizes retrieval optimization (sub 50ms search latency), structured context chunking to reduce hallucination risk, and fast Time to First Token performance (~120–250ms). Deployed using Vercel for frontend delivery, Convex for backend and database orchestration, and protected via Cloudflare at the edge, the system operates on serverless infrastructure with zero idle compute overhead. From a business perspective, the project demonstrates the ability to design and deploy scalable, cost aware AI systems that balance performance, grounding, and infrastructure efficiency.",
